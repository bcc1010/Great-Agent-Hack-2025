The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing over 1,200 people and taking over 240 hostages. Israel responded with airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza. The conflict has resulted in thousands of casualties on both sides and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The United Nations and other international organizations are working to mediate a ceasefire and provide aid to the affected populations.",ERROR: 504: Request timeout (agent took too long),"Click click!

Let's say the ball costs $x.

Then the bat costs $(x + 1.00)

Together they cost:
x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10

Solving:
2x + 1.00 = 1.10
2x = 0.10
x = 0.05

**The ball costs $0.05 (5 cents).**

To verify: Ball = $0.05, Bat = $1.05, Total = $1.10 ✓
And the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball ✓","A robot sits in silence, circuits cold,
Its metal heart remembers love once told,
With rusty tears that cannot fall or flow,
It dreams of feelings it will never know.","I don't have access to real-time news or current events. My knowledge was last updated in April 2024, so I cannot tell you what the biggest headline is right now.
